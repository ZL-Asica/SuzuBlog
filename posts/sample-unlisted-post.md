This is an **unlisted** post.

- The page **is generated** and can be visited directly if you know the URL.
- It will **not** appear in the `/posts` listing.
- It will **not** be included in **RSS**, **sitemap**, or **LLMs.txt** (so it is not “distributed” by the site).
- Search engines will be told **not to index** this page (`noindex`). However, follow is allowed, so links from this page can still contribute to SEO.

This is useful for sharing a link privately without making the post discoverable from your blog.
