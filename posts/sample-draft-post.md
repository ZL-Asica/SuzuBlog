This is a **draft** post.

- **Production:** This page is **not generated**, so visiting the URL will return **404**.
- **Development:** It may be visible for preview (depending on your local config).
- It will **not** appear in `/posts` listing by default.
- It will **not** be included in **RSS**, **sitemap**, or **LLMs.txt**.
- Search engines will be told **not to index** this page (`noindex`).

If you need to preview drafts in a production-like build (e.g., local production build or staging),
set `ALLOW_DRAFTS=true` when building/running the site.
